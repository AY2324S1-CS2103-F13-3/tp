### Project: EventWise

EventWise is a event management desktop application used for managing contacts and details specific to an event. It combines the flexibility of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and the benefits of a Graphical User Interace (GUI). Designed for event planners, EventWise helps you to easily track and access crucial information in a single place, simplifying event coordination and communication. It is written in Java and has about 16 kLoc.

### My Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Add new `viewEvent` command to display a details specific to an event.
  * What it does: allows the user to view details specific to an event such as the description, date, note and venue information as well as a list of vendors and a list of attendees associated to the event.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to access important information related to a specific event in a single place.
  * Highlights: This enhancement integrates the associations of the `Person`, `Vendor` and `Venue` with `Event` and requires changes to the existing AddressBook and Model interfaces.
