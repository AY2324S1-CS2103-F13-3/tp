### Project: EventWise

EventWise is a event management desktop application used for managing contacts and details specific to an event. It combines the flexibility of a Command Line Interface (CLI) and the benefits of a Graphical User Interace (GUI). Designed for event planners, EventWise helps you to easily track and access crucial information in a single place, simplifying event coordination and communication. It is written in Java and has about 16 kLoc.
